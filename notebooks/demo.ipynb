       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">housing, etc. Human psychology deals with how people think, feel, and behave. The user is asking about patterns </span>\n",

       "\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">First, I should consider existing research. I know that walkable neighborhoods encourage physical activity, which </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">in turn affects mental health. But what about less obvious aspects? Maybe the layout of a city influences social </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">interactions. For example, do cities with more parks and communal areas foster stronger communities, leading to </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">lower stress levels? That's a possible angle.</span>\n",
       "\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">Another thought: urban density. High-density areas can lead to stress due to overcrowding, but maybe there's a </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">psychological threshold. How do people perceive space, and how does that affect their well-being? Maybe certain </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">architectural designs, like high-rise vs. low-rise buildings, impact social cohesion differently.</span>\n",

       "\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">I should also think about transportation. Commuting stress is a big issue. How do different transportation systems </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000; font-weight: bold\">(</span><span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">public transit vs. cars</span><span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000; font-weight: bold\">)</span><span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\"> influence people's daily stress levels and overall life satisfaction?

       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">transit hubs can either alleviate or exacerbate anxiety based on factors like crowding and wait times.</span>\n",

       "\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration-color: #000000\">Another angle: urban planning policies and their psychological effects. For example, mixed-use developments that </span>\n",
